Description: Lambert et. al (1992) found that Poisson and Negative Binomial models failed to accurately estimate
	results when count outcomes had excess zeroes. Lambert then developed the Zero-Inflated Poisson Model (ZIP). ZIP
	is a mixture distribution of a Bernoulli distribution of the probability of an excess zero and a Poisson model of the
	mean of the suscpetible population. Preisser et. al (2012) found that often times these coefficients of the ZIP model
	were not interpreted correctly as many researchers are not interested in the "mean of the susceptible population", but 
	rather the mean of the whole population. Long et. al (2014) in response to this developed the Marginalized
	Zero-Inflated Poisson Model (MZIP) that accounts for excess zeros and has more easily interpretable results. The MZIP
	model is essentially the same model as the ZIP model, but directly models the overall mean in the Poisson part. This
	allows for alpha coefficients to be interpreted as risk ratios of the population average effect.
